Sam created the huersitic for week 1 and then improved it and applied it 
to week two's alpha beta pruning. Sam also helped create the minimax with 
Grace as well as the random move player.

Grace created the alpha beta pruning algorithm for the player and helped 
helped create the minimax with Sam as well as the random move player and 
improving the huersitic.

The first week we attempted to implement a minixmax algorithm, but it was
unsuccessful and we decided to just submit our huersitic player instead.
For week 2, we fixed the minimax algoritm and implement the beta- alpha pruning
algorithm in order to increase the depth of our player. I think our bot is 
worthy for the tournment because it can sometimes beat the constant player
bot. The reason why our bot is not unstoppable is because we were not able
to tune our hueristic to be the most effective for winning the othello game.
